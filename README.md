# PortSwigger Web Security Academy Enhanced (Chrome Extension)

## Keep track of what learning materials you have completed in the PortSwigger Web Security Academy, all on one page.

### Note: I am not affiliated with PortSwigger in any way. This is a personal project to enhance the Web Security Academy experience. I was having trouble keeping track of which learning materials I had completed, so I created this extension to easily view progress on one screen.
